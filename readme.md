# Note trainer
A simple page to help note recognition.  It displays a note and listens for that note to come back.  Will tell you if you got it right or not.

## Running
Just open the index.html page.  There's no framework, everything runs in-browser for now.

## Future work
* make the positive validation stay on the page for a few seconds before moving on
* chord support (for piano)
