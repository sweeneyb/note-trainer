# Note trainer
A simple page to help note recognition.  It displays a note and listens for that note to come back.  Will tell you if you got it right or not.

## Running
Just open the index.html page.  There's no framework, everything runs in-browser for now.

## Future work
* Auto-progress to the next note when a match/mismatch is detected.
* chord support (for piano)
*
